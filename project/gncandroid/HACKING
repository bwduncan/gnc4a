Hacking on gnc4a
================

Building the code
-----------------

Start by getting the android SDK. Follow the instructions at:

http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html

You will also need Apache Ant. It's in Debian/Ubuntu as "ant" and available at:

http://ant.apache.org/

Once you have installed the dependencies, start an Android Virtual Device (AVD)
and run this:

cd <path to source>/project/gncandroid
android update project --target <AVD target> --path .
ant install

That's it!

Contributing to gnc4a
---------------------

Follow the Java coding conventions at:

http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/

unless doing so would break the existing convention in a source file. Try to
be consistent where possible.
